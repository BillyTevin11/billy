        <h1>MONITORING THE EFFECT OF ALGAL BLOOMS ON THE LESSER FLAMINGO HABITAT IN LAKE NAKURU NATIONAL PARK</h1>
        <p>
          The project aims to monitor the impact of algal blooms on the habitat of lesser flamingos in Lake Nakuru, 
          a renowned alkaline lake located in Kenya. Algal blooms can significantly affect 
          the ecological balance of the lake, potentially disrupting the food chain and threatening the 
          survival of lesser flamingos, which heavily rely on the lake's unique ecosystem. 
          By studying the relationship between algal blooms and flamingo habitat, this 
          project seeks to provide valuable insights for conservation efforts and the sustainable 
          management of Lake Nakuru.</p>
